                <p>Hello, my name is Andrew McLain. I am going into my senior year at Perry Meridian High School with a GPA of 4.5. During my time at perry, I have enrolled in a vairety of Honors and AP classes, and, during my next year, I plan on taking an additional 5 AP classes. I applied for the AP Capstone program my Sophmore year and was accepted into the two-year program. Other things that I have done at Perry include: taking part in the Early College program provided through VU, competing for the WRAL team, and having played for two year in the band.</p>
                <p>In terms of work experience, I have been a referee of soccer since 2018. I also applied for the Nextech Catapult Summer Internship this year and was accepted for the internship. Through this internship, I have learned a lot more about Computer Science in general, additional coding languages as well as different careers. More importantly, however, is that I have built connections with my peers that have similar interests as well as building good work-place habits.</p>
                <p>I have quite the number of hobbies that I enjoy dujring my spare time. The biggest thing that I enjoy during my free time is playing video games, especially with my friends. I don't neccessarily have a favorite type of video game because I play so many different kinds. ALong with this, I also enjoy playing a variety of sports that I used to play growing up.</p>
